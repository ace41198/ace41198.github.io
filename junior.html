      <p>I was given the oppoortunity to dance with underprivledged kids while my class and I taught them some fundamentals of coding. While the mixture may seem strange, it turned into two of the most fun days I'll ever have at Southwest.</p>

      <p>My illegitimate father Mr. Moore was the perfect subject for this project in which we had to Photoshop someone's face with various distortions on them. And who better to distort than one of our very own teachers at my school.</p>

      <p>I am an avid Youtube enthusiast as I am constantly watching different videos on anything and everything. With all of these Youtubers I have come across, I decided to make a collage of all of the ones I knew as well as other famous people.</p>

      <p>Junior year introduced us to Sketchbook Pro which was very difficult for me at first because I am not the greatest artist when it comes to drawing but the fact that it is all on the computer helped me to understand what I needed to do when painting these fruits.</p>

      <p>My partner, Matthew Gaza, and I love cats, especially cats on the internet because they are everywhere and are always very cute. So we decided to make an infographic all about the internet and cats together because they really do make a wonderful pair.</p>

      <p>I was in SkillsUSA for my junior and senior year of high school and even went to State my junior year and this is what I submitted for my t-shirt design competition. I unfortunately did not win but I was very proud of what I had made.</p>
